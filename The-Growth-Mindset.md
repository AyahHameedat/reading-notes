# **The Growth Mindest**

### **Upgrade your technical skills**

#### We have to practice to get more experience with a lot of challenges and learn how we can solve them or deal with them, The goals of the challenges should be picked such that achieving them teaches you something new. It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what you learned on the way.

### **The power of believing that you can improve**
### As Carol Dweck said:
#### **Let's not waste any more lives, because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth, it becomes a basic human right for children to live in places that create that growth to live in places filled with"yet".**

### **The power of passion and perseverance**

#### IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled. A growth mindset is a belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.

### **A kinder, gentler philosophy of success**
