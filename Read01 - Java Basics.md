# Java Basics

#### Java is defined by a specification and consists of a programming language, a compiler, core libraries, and a runtime (Java virtual machine) The Java runtime allows software developers to write program code in other languages than the Java programming language which still runs on the Java virtual machine. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems.
### let's start with The basics of this amazing Language!

### - Variables
#### Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.

#### A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

### The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

#### Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): 
##### Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block.

#### Class Variables (Static Fields):
##### These variables are declared similarly as instance variables. The difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.

## Example of Instance Variables & Class Variables:
<br>        
    
    class AYA         
     {      
    
    // Static variable
        static int a; 
    
    
    // Instance variable    
        int b;        
    
    }    

#### Local Variables: 
##### A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable.

#### Parameters:
##### The important thing to remember is that parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields".

### Naming:
##### 1) Always begin your variables' names with a letter, not allowed to begin with symbols like ($, _,....).
##### 2) White space is not permitted.


### - Operators




### - Expressions, Statements, and Blocks




### - Control Flow Statements
