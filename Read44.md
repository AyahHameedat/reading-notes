## Ethics in the workplace: The code I’m still ashamed of
#### If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical.
By age 21, I managed to land a full-time coding job with an interactive marketing firm in Toronto, Canada.
The firm had been founded by a medical doctor and many of its clients were large pharmaceutical companies.
In Canada, there are strict limits on how pharmaceutical companies can advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers.
As a result, these companies would create websites that present general information about whatever symptoms their drugs were meant to address. Then, if a visitor could prove they had a prescription, they were given access to a patient portal with more specific info about the drug.
As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.
We’re approaching a time when the software will drive the vehicle that transports your family to soccer practice. There are already AI programs that help doctors diagnose diseases. It’s not hard to imagine them recommending prescription drugs soon, too.
The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code.


## Ethics in Technology: The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars
"Nobody's talking about ethics," Ford Motor Co. chairman Bill Ford said a year ago, speaking with The Globe and Mail's Greg Keenan and a small group of reporters. "If this technology is really going to serve society, then these kinds of issues have to be resolved, and resolved relatively soon."

We already have the technology.

"The greater challenge is the artificial intelligence behind the machine," Toyota Canada president Larry Hutchinson said, addressing the TalkAuto Conference in Toronto last November. "Think of the millions of situations that we process and decisions that we have to make in real traffic. … We need to program that intelligence into a vehicle, but we don't have the data yet to create a machine that can perceive and respond to the virtually endless permutations of near misses and random occurrences that happen on even a simple trip to the corner store."
