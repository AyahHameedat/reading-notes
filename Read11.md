# Read: 11 - Spring

### The Spring Framework (Spring) is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications. One of the most popular Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) frameworks, Spring helps developers create high-performing applications using plain old Java objects (POJOs).

### Advantages of the Spring Framework:

+ It is lightweight in nature due to its POJO implementation, which doesn’t force us to inherit any class or implement any interfaces.
+ The Spring Framework supports other frameworks and its integration makes Spring easier to develop.
+ The Spring application is loosely coupled due to the Dependency Injection.
+ The Spring Framework is easier to test, and it doesn’t require any server to run the application.
+ It provides a powerful abstraction to JavaEE Specifications, like JDBC, JTA, etc.


### Disadvantages of Spring Framework:

+ The learning curve for Spring Framework is very high as most developers find it hard to understand and apply.
+ The nature of the Spring Framework keeps changing over the course of time, which makes it harder to grasp. For example, the annotation-based Spring is not everybody’s cup of tea.
+ For many, it's a time-consuming process, as the Spring Framework has lots of integration with another framework, due to which it is hard to know all the options that are available.
