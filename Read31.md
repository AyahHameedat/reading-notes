# **Read: 31 - Amplify**


## **What is AWS Amplify?**
#### AWS Amplify was officially announced in November of 2017 and quickly became popular among full stack developers. Looking to compete with other rapid development, full stack hosting products such as Google Firebase and Netlify, Amplify offered something these other product’s didn’t: direct feature integration with AWS’ powerful backend services.

#### I like to think of AWS Amplify as a kind of glue service. It really doesn’t offer any particular core functionality besides helping you integrate with other AWS services, albeit it does it in a very different way.
