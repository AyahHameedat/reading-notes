# **Read: 08 - OO Design**

###  Principle of Software Development:
##### 1) "Don't repeat yourself" **(DRY)** is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
##### 2) **(WET)** The opposing view to DRY is called WET, commonly taken to stand for "write everything twice"(alternatively "write every time", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time"). WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with.
##### 3) **(AHA)** Another approach to abstractions is the AHA principle. AHA stands for "avoid hasty abstractions", described by Kent C. Dodds as optimizing for change first, and avoiding premature optimization. and was influenced by Sandi Metz's "prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction".


# **Rule of three**

### Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. 


# **You aren't gonna need it**

#### "You aren't gonna need it" is a principle that arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.



# **Minimum viable product**
### A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.

## Purposes
+ Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
+ Accelerate learning
+ Reduce wasted engineering hours
+ Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
+ The base for other products
+ To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
+ Brand building very quickly

## **Notable quotes**
### **Steve Blank: "Youâ€™re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone."**
